//Global object is same like browser's window object
In the windew Obj there is lots of method and properties, like that Global Obj also have many methods and properties.

In Test.js

console.log(global);

to run --> node Test // list of methods and properties.

In Test.js
console.log(_dirname) //gives the absolute path of the folder
console.log(_filename) //gives the absolute path of the file

//_dirname and _filename,setInterval(), setTimeout() are the properties of the global Obj.

window Obj can access te DOm nodes but the global Obj can't.
for an example: global Obj can't use the querySelector.
