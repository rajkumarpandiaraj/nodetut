                                    1.Request Obj

whenever we made a request a func in the createServer() got triggered and that func has two ars req and res.
now we gonna see about the req obj.

In server.js
    const http = require('http');

    const server = http.createServer((req, res) =>{
        console.log(req) //request obj has so many properties
        console/log(req.url, req.method) // prints url entered in the browser http and method type like get,pos like that
    });

    server.listen(3000, 'localhost', () =>{
    console.log('listening for request on port 3000')
})

o/p 
node server

now we open the localhost:3000 in browser ,the request was made and req obj , req url and req method got printed.
In terminal
{request obj with many properties}
/ GET //  GET is the method type and / is the url

if we type the url as localhost:3000/about,
In terminal
{request obj with many properties}
/about GET //  GET is the method type and /about is the url


as far now we didn't get any response in the browser window, in next topic lets see that.
