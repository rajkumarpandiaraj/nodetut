                                        1.server

Now we ae going to create a server and make the server to listen for the request with unique port number.

In server.js
    const http = require('http');

    const server = http.createServer((req, res) =>{
        console.log('request made')
    })

//here http.createServer() creates the server and createServer() func takes func as its args and run that func whenever we made the req in the browser.
//saving the createServer() instance in the const server for the further use of server.

//Now we gonna make the server to listen for the particular port number.

server.listen(3000, 'localhost', () =>{
    console.log('listening for request on port 3000')
})

//here listen() makes the server to listen for th request
//listen() takes three args 
    1.port number
    2.domain name, by default it is localhost
    3.func, which got triggered when the server is started to listen for the request.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
                                    localhost and Port number

-> localhost is like domain name on the web
-> port number are like doors in computer.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
In server.js
    const http = require('http');

    const server = http.createServer((req, res) =>{
        console.log('request made')
    });

    server.listen(3000, 'localhost', () =>{
    console.log('listening for request on port 3000')
})

o/p
node server
listening for request on port 300 got printed in the terminal after the server listen for the server

if we run the localhost:3000 in browser the page got loads and waits for the res, but we didn't provide any response
but "request made" got printed in terminal.
